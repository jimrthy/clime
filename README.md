# clime: Goal

This is an old, obsolete repo that I'm really just not deleting as an
historical oddity.

I had an interviewer ask me about it recently. Specifically, "Why?"

Here's the original README:

    Basically, port slime to common lisp.

    McClim already uses swank, for something. Might as well go the next logical
    step and steal^H^H^H^H^Hport the emacs portions into DREI.

McClim is/was an effort to create an open source implementation of the Common
Lisp Interface Manager. I got interested in the project because porting emacs
to Common Lisp seemed like a better idea than learning emacs lisp.

Which is where this silly muddle came from.

I obviously came to my senses more quickly than I do for most of my hare-brained
schemes, since I haven't gotten past the initial overview README checkin before
now.

So, really, this is just a bad spot on memory lane.
